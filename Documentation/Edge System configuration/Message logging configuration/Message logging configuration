Edge System writes log messages to flat text files in the following locations:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs
Each message in the log displays the message severity level, timestamp, and the message itself. To change which messages are logged, see Change logging levels.
