By default, Edge system captures Information, Warning and Error messages in the message log. To adjust this behavior, complete the following:
	
The schema file System.Logging.Schema.json specifies how to formally describe the configuration parameters for Edge System message logging. It is located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramFiles%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Schema
•	Linux: /opt/EdgeSystem/Schema

1. 	
Open the System_Logging.json file located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
	
The individual components of Edge System have their own logging files, for example:
•	Modbus TCP connectivity: Modbus1_Logging.json
•	OPC UA connectivity: OpcUa1_Logging.json
•	Edge Data Store (EDS): Storage_Logging.json
2. 	
Change the LogLevel value to one of the following:

Verbose
    Captures all messages: Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning and Error 
Debug
    Captures most messages: Debug, Information, Warning and Error 
Information
    Captures most messages: Information, Warning and Error 
Warning
    Captures only Warning and Error messages 
Error
    Captures Error messages only 

	
•	Changing the Log Level affects which messages are captured, not which messages are displayed. Edge System applies the change immediately after you save the System_Logging.json.
•	Auto-detection of configuration changes might not work correctly for every text editor. For example, auto-detection does not work in the default text editor for an Ubuntu distribution. Use a text editor such as nano or LibreOffice Writer to ensure proper functionality.
