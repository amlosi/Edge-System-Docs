This procedure explains how you can configure the port on which the Edge System will be bound to.
Edge System stores port configuration in the System_Port.json file located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
If you change the System_Port.json file, the updates will be reflected on the next startup of the Edge System.
