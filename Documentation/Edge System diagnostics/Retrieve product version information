## Retrieve product version information

The first thing you should verify after you have Edge System installed is the product version information. This information can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.


* Use any REST client and make a request using the following:
  -	Method: GET
  - Endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/Diagnostics/productinformation
  - Header: Content-Type application/json
  
Example using cURL:

...
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:5590/api/v1/Diagnostics/productinformation
...

For more information on REST routes, see REST request reference.


You should see product version information similar to the following:

...
"Edge System": "0.7.0.526", ".Net Core Version": ".NETCoreApp,Version=v2.2", "Core CLR Version": ".NET Core 4.6.27617.05", "Operating System": "Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134"
...
