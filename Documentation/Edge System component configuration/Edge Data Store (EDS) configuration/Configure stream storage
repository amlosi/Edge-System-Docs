You can configure stream storage parameters as needed. Stream storage configuration parameters are stored in the Storage_StreamStorage.json file located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
<Table: Configuration Parameters for stream storage>
	
The schema file Storage_StreamStorage.Schema.json specifies how to formally describe the stream storage parameters for EDS. It is located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramFiles%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Schema
•	Linux: /opt/EdgeSystem/Schema

1. 	
Open Storage_StreamStorage.json in any text editor.
Recommended text editors for Linux are nano or Libre Office Writer.
2. 	
Modify the parameters with values as shown in this example:

{ "StreamStorageLimitMB": 2, "StreamStorageTargetMB": 1 }

3. 	
Save and copy the file to all the devices that are running Edge System.
4. 	
Use any REST client and make a request using the following:
•	Method: PUT
•	Endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/storage/StreamStorage
•	Header: Content-Type application/json
•	Body: Storage_StreamStorage.json
Example using curl:

curl -v -d "Storage_StreamStorage.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/storage/StreamStorage

For more information on REST routes, see REST request reference.

If the HTTP status of the request is 204, the request was successful and stream storage is configured.
