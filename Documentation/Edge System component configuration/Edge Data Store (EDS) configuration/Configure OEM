You can configure transaction logging parameters as needed. OEM configuration parameters are stored in the Storage_OEM.json file located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
<Table: Configuration Parameters for Storage OEM>
	
The schema file Storage_OEM.Schema.json specifies how to formally describe the OEM parameters for EDS. It is located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramFiles%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Schema
•	Linux: /opt/EdgeSystem/Schema

1. 	
Open Storage_OEM.json in any text editor.
Recommended text editors for Linux are nano or Libre Office Writer.
2. 	
Modify the parameters with values as shown in this example:

{ "CheckpointRateInSec": 30, "TransactionLogLimitMB": 250, "EnableTransactionLog": true }

3. 	
Save and copy the file to all the devices that are running Edge System.
4.

•	Method: PUT
•	Endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/storage/OEM
•	Header: Content-Type application/json
•	Body: Storage_OEM.json
