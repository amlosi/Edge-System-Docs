You configure the port of the Edge System by editing or creating configuration files, saving them to your local device, and then making REST requests to the provided endpoints to write them to the correct location in Edge System. Alternatively, you can configure the components of Edge System through command-line (Windows) or terminal (Linux).

Configure port using REST

This procedure explains how you can configure the port on which the Edge System will be bound to.
Edge System stores port configuration in the System_Port.json file located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
If you change the System_Port.json file, the updates will be reflected on the next startup of the Edge System.

•	Header: Content-Type application/json
•	Body: System_port.json
Example using cURL:

curl -v -d "@System_Port.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system
