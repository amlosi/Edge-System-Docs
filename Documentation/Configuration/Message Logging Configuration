Edge System writes log messages to flat text files in the following locations:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs
Each message in the log displays the message severity level, timestamp, and the message itself. To change which messages are logged, see Change logging levels.


Change logging levels

By default, Edge system captures Information, Warning and Error messages in the message log. To adjust this behavior, complete the following:
	
The schema file System.Logging.Schema.json specifies how to formally describe the configuration parameters for Edge System message logging. It is located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramFiles%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Schema
•	Linux: /opt/EdgeSystem/Schema

1. 	
Open the System_Logging.json file located in:
•	Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
•	Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Configuration
	
The individual components of Edge System have their own logging files, for example:
•	Modbus TCP connectivity: Modbus1_Logging.json
•	OPC UA connectivity: OpcUa1_Logging.json
•	Edge Data Store (EDS): Storage_Logging.json
2. 	
Change the LogLevel value to one of the following:

Verbose
    Captures all messages: Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning and Error 
Debug
    Captures most messages: Debug, Information, Warning and Error 
Information
    Captures most messages: Information, Warning and Error 
Warning
    Captures only Warning and Error messages 
Error
    Captures Error messages only 

	
•	Changing the Log Level affects which messages are captured, not which messages are displayed. Edge System applies the change immediately after you save the System_Logging.json.
•	Auto-detection of configuration changes might not work correctly for every text editor. For example, auto-detection does not work in the default text editor for an Ubuntu distribution. Use a text editor such as nano or LibreOffice Writer to ensure proper functionality. 


Configure message logging on Windows

Message logging is enabled by default on Windows. The logs are saved in .txt file format to %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs, and are created daily. 


Configure message logging on Linux

Message logging is enabled by default on Linux. The logs are saved at in .txt file format/usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeSystem/Logs, and are created daily.
