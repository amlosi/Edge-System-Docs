If you have questions, comments, issues, and other feedback about the Edge System beta software, send an email to Edge Data support (edgesupport@osisoft.com).
As a member of the Edge Data Store beta program, you also have access to a private community on PI Square called Edge Data Store. The Edge Data Store community is monitored by members of the Edge Data Store development team. You can use this site to ask questions, request advice and share ideas about working with the Edge System with other community members.
Once the Edge System is released for general availability, access to OSIsoft Technical Support will be available and will be used instead of the previously mentioned options.
